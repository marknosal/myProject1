This is my readme file

The purpose of my Phase 1 project is to keep a tally on all the video games.
On this page you there is a button that you can click (event listener 1).
This opens a submission form (event listener 2).  You can enter new video game's title, genre, developer, and a link to the logo of the video game.
Once you submit that form it will close and reset the form so you can continue to add new titles.
As you add them they are added below will everything you entered displayed.
You can mouse of each individual video game and the border will thicken or thin depending on if your mouse is over the game (event listener 3). You need to move the mouse slowly to make sure the event listener picks up the location of the mouse.
I also added checkboxes that will change the border and show if you have completed that particular game.  That isn't finished yet because I haven't made the server automatically update the DOM when you refresh the page, but that will come in the future.
I have used some of the functions from my solution to the toy-tale lab in the 'Applying Your Learning' section of phase 1.# myProject1
